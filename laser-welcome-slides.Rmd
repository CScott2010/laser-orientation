# The Friday Institute for Educational Innovation

At The Friday Institute, **our mission is to advance K-12 education through innovation** in teaching, learning and leadership so that ALL students are prepared to succeed in a rapidly changing world.

- **Educate.** We conduct professional learning, research and evaluation.
- **Innovate.** We design supports, tools and structures for educational change.
- **Inspire.** We convene and collaborate with partners in education, government and private industries to inform standards, policy and practice.

The LASER Institute is a prime example of how we [Think and Do](https://www.ncsu.edu/think-and-do/) at the Friday Institute and we hope that you will carry this mission and vision forward!

# Summer Workshop Components

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Learning Labs]
Each Content Area (i.e., Foundations, Text Mining, Machine Learning, and Netowrk Analysis) will consist of four progressively sequenced Learning Labs that include: 
- **Intro Workshop** to summarize core concepts and practice key R skills
- **Essential reading(s)** and discussions that unpack core concepts
- **Guided practice** with key R skills consisting of a [Case Study](https://laser-institute.github.io/aera-workshop/pages/text-mining-demo.html) (ML, TM, and SNA) or [tutorial](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) (FLA, VIZ)
- **Independent analysis** that applies the concepts/skills to a dataset provided or their own 
- A **badge/microcredential** that demonstrates their competency


]


.panel[.panel-name[Guest Speakers]

Our Guest Speaker series will feature authors of the recently updated [Handbook of Learning Analytics](https://www.solaresearch.org/publications/hla-22/) presented by their author(s) presenting topics such as: 
- What is learning analytics?
- Learning Analytics for Understanding and Supporting Collaboration
- Data Literacy and Learning Analytics
- Learning Analytics and Learning at Scale
- Fairness, Absence of Bias, and Equity in Learning Analytics

]



.panel[.panel-name[Community Building]

We've partnered with [Participate, Inc.](https://www.participate.com) to help us: 
- develop in-person and online **community-building activities**
- organize **affinity groups** for collaborative research 
- structure monthly **progress updates** with scholars
- facilitate online **discussions forums**

# LASER Institute Goals

.panelset[


.panel[.panel-name[This Year]

1. **Disciplinary Knowledge**: Deepen understanding of LA methodologies, literature, applications and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education and equity.

2. **Technical Skills:** Develop proficiency with R,  GitHub and other tools for collaboration, reproducible research and computational analysis.

3. **Social Capital:** Expand their professional networks, connecting with researchers and experts in LA related fields, as well as other scholars focused on STEM education.
